Private variables in sphere:
    double radius
    double x
    double y
    double z

Default Constructor (void, no params)

Constructor (void, parameters: r, x, y, z (all double))

Calc surface area (double, no params)

Calc volume (double, no params)

Calc distance from center (double, parameters: x, y, z (all double))

Check if spheres intersect (boolean, parameters sphere object sphere2)

Main class:
    create 3 sphere objects with x,y,z and radius

    print out each one of the objects surface area using get Surface area method

    print out each one of the objects vloumes using get volume method

    use if statments calling the overlap method to see if they overlap
